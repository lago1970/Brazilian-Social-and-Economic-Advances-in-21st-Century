Age-specific enrollment rates are approximated using school enrollment rates at different levels: pre-primary enrollment rates approximate the age-specific enrolment rates for 4 and 5 year-olds; the primary rate approximates for 6-11 year-olds; the lower-secondary rate approximates for 12-14 year-olds; and the upper-secondary approximates for 15-17 year-olds.
